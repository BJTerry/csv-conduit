## CSV files

CSV files are the de-facto standard in arbitrary data retrieval, transfer or hand-off occasions. It is text-based, which means almost any application can understand them and can scale up to very large sizes.

While their scalability is great, working with large CSV files is very difficult due to memory restrictions.


## This package

This package is intended as a CSV parser that can operate efficiently in constant-space using iteratees.
